0.11.3p9: (2003-07029)
- Added support for the old synaptics protocol. By Hartwig Felger.

0.11.3p8: (2003-07-20)
- From Hartwig Felger:
  * Added "multi-buttons" to the FEATURES list.
  * Updated NEWS file with data from the web page.
  * More robust parsing of the Handlers= line when doing auto detection
    for 2.6 kernels. ("Handlers=event2 js0" should work now.)
  * Updated synclient program to explain that it can't query hardware
    details when using a 2.6 kernel.

0.11.3p7: (2003-07-17)
- Added support for touchpads with "multi buttons". (Hartwig Felger)
- Mention the synclient program in the INSTALL file.
- Updated COMPATIBILITY file.
- Implemented protocol "auto-dev" that automatically tries to find the
  proper device node and protocol for the touchpad. This makes it
  possible to have the same XF86Config file for 2.4 and 2.5 kernels.
  (Hartwig Felger)

0.11.3p6: (2003-07-13)
- Build fix for gentoo linux.

  driver has shown that 4 seconds is needed for some touchpads.
- Made horizontal wheel replacement buttons work. (Patch from Hartwig
  Felger.)
- Improved driver initialisation and finalization. From Hartwig
  Felger.
- Reset the touchpad to relative mode when the X server
  terminates. (So that you can run gpm afterwards for example.)
- Implemented install target in the Makefile.
