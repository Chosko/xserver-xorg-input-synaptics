===========================================================

needs: - XFree 4.x
       - Using with Kernel 2.4.x for x < 10 needs a kernel-patch (see
         source-code)

1. If you installing the driver by binary (recommended) you can go to
step 3.

2. Change in the "Makefile" the path to the xfree-sourcecode tree by
changig the Variable TOP. Then type "make" to build the driver
"synaptics_drv.o".

3. Copy the driver-modul "snyaptics_drv.o" into the XFree-module path
"ex. /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input/".

4. Load the driver by changig the XFree configuration file through
adding the line 'Load "synaptics"' in the module section.

5. Add/Replace in the InputDevice-section for the touchpad the
following lines:

Section "InputDevice"
  Driver  	"synaptics"
  Identifier  	"Mouse[1]"
  Option 	"Device"  	"/dev/psaux"
  Option	"Protocol"	"psaux"
  Option	"LeftEdge"      "1900"
  Option	"RightEdge"     "5400"
  Option	"TopEdge"       "3900"
  Option	"BottomEdge"    "1800"
  Option	"FingerLow"	"25"
  Option	"FingerHigh"	"30"
  Option	"MaxTapTime"	"180"
  Option	"MaxTapMove"	"220"
  Option	"VertScrollDelta" "100"
  Option	"MinSpeed"	"0.02"
  Option	"MaxSpeed"	"0.18"
  Option	"AccelFactor" "0.0010"
#  Option	"Repeater"	"/dev/ps2mouse"
#  Option	"SHMConfig"	"on"
EndSection

Change the Identifier to the same name as in the ServerLayout-section.
The Option "Repeater" und "SHMConfig" are at the moment for testing.

6. Add the "CorePointer" option to the InputDevice line at the ServerLayout section:

Section "ServerLayout"
...
  InputDevice "Mouse[1]"  "CorePointer"
...

7. Start/Restart the X-Server. If the touchpad doesn't work go to
step 8.

8. a) Check the XFree-Logfiles
   b) Try to start the XServer with 'startx -- -logverbose 8' for more
      Output

If you can't get the driver working, mail the logfiles and the
configuration file to me.
