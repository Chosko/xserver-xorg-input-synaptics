===========================================================

needs: - XFree 4.x
       - Using with Kernel 2.4.x for x < 10 needs a kernel-patch (see
         source-code)

1. If you installing the driver by binary (recommended) you can go to
step 3.

2. Change in the "Makefile" the path to the xfree-sourcecode tree by
changig the Variable TOP. Then type "make" to build the driver
"synaptics_drv.o".

3. Copy the driver-modul "snyaptics_drv.o" into the XFree-module path
"ex. /usr/X11R6/lib/modules/input/".

4. Load the driver by changig the XFree configuration file through
adding the line 'Load "synaptics"' in the modul-section.

5. Add/Replace in the InputDevice-section for the touchpad the
following lines:

Section "InputDevice"
  Driver  	"synaptics"
  Identifier  	"Mouse[1]"
  Option 	"Device"  	"/dev/psaux"
  Option	"Edges"		"1900 5400 1800 3900"
  Option	"Finger"	"25 30"
  Option	"MaxTapTime" "20"
  Option	"MaxTapMove" "220"
  Option	"VertScrollDelta" "100"
  Option	"MinSpeed"	"0.02"
  Option	"MaxSpeed"	"0.18"
  Option	"AccelFactor" "0.0010"
#  Option	"Repeater"	"/dev/ps2mouse"
#  Option	"SHMConfig"	"on"
EndSection

Change the Identifier to the same name as in the ServerLayout-section.
The Option "Repeater" und "SHMConfig" are at the moment for testing.

6. Start/Restart the X-Server. If the touchpad doesn't work go to
step 7.

7. a) Check the XFree-Logfiles
   b) Try to start the XServer with 'startx -- -logverbose 8' for more
      Output
If you can't get the driver working, mail the logfiles and the
configuration file to me.
